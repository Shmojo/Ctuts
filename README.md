Hi. My name is Craig Amiano. My dad is evil because he wrote this. 

He could have written all kids of embarrassing but true stuff about me here, but he didn't. 
He simply asked me to fill out the Readme and experiment with the tutorial programs, and show his work in commits. 
That was two days ago, and I haven't posted anything to show I was listening. 

So now, he put up this crap on the Readme, and it will stay up here until I get the initiative to remove it.
Plus, because he made the change on Github, no I'll may have merge conflicts, and may have to learn about how to resolve them.
